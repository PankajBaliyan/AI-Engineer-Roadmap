    "# Python performs name mangling of private variables. Every member with a double underscore will be changed to _object._class__variable. So, it can still be accessed from outside the class, but the practice should be refrained.\n",

    "# Private variables that cannot be accessed are created by using double underscore __ in front of the variable name.\n",
    "# Private methods that cannot be accessed are created by using double underscore __ in front of the method name.\n",
